# IMPLEMENTING A CLIENT-SERVER ARCHITECTURE USING MYSQL DATABASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM ON AWS

## Project Overview:

This project guides you through building a client-server system using MySQL as the database management system on Amazon Web Services (AWS). You'll create a MySQL server instance and a client instance on separate EC2 instances, configure security groups for network access control, install and configure MySQL server software, connect to the server from the client, and explore basic database management tasks.

## Prerequisites:

- An AWS account with administrative privileges
- Basic understanding of AWS services (EC2 Security Groups)
- Familiarity with Red Hat Linux and SSH


### Client-Server Architecture Explained

Before diving into the implementation, let's understand the core concept of client-server architecture:


![Client-Server-architecture](images/Client-server-model.svg.png)



**Clients** are typically user workstations or personal devices that initiate requests for resources or services from a server. They have a user interface that allows users to interact with the application and display the information received from the server.

**Servers** are powerful computers that  host, manage, and deliver the resources and services requested by clients.  They can handle multiple client requests simultaneously and  provide security access control.

### How Client-Server Architecture Works:

- Client Requests Service: A client initiates communication by sending a request for a service or resource to the server. This request could be anything from fetching a web page to retrieving data from a database.

- Server Processes Request: The server receives the request from the client and processes it. This may involve executing a specific task, retrieving data from a database, or performing any other operation required to fulfill the client's request.

- Server Sends Response: Once the server has processed the request, it sends a response back to the client. This response contains the requested data or indicates the outcome of the requested operation.

- Client Receives Response: The client receives the response from the server and takes appropriate action based on the information received. This could involve displaying the requested data to the user, processing it further, or making additional requests to the server.

## Step-by-Step Implementation:

### Step 1 - Set Up AWS EC2 instance and Configure the Security group

- Create two security groups:
    1. MySQL-client-sg: This group will only allow inbound SSH traffic on port 22.

    2. MySQL-server-sg: This security group will allow inbound SSH traffic on port 22 and MySQL traffic on port 3306 (only from the client machine's Private IP address to restrict database access).

- Launch two seperate instances one for MySQL server (db-server) the other for MySQL-client (client-machine). Choose Red Hat distribution as the operating system. 

![Instances](images/instances-launched.png)

- Associate the respective security groups (MySQL-client-sg and MySQL-server-sg) with each corresponding EC2 instance.

- Launch and connect to both EC2 instances.  

### Step 2 - Install MySQL Server software on the mysql-server EC2 instance

- Update package repository:

```
sudo apt update -y
```

- Install MySQL Server

```
sudo apt install mysql-server -y
```

- Start the MySQL service and enable it to start automatically at boot with : 

```
sudo systemctl start mysql

sudo systemctl enable mysql
```

- Verify the status of Mysql service:

```
sudo systemctl status mysql
```

### Step 3 - Install MySQL Client Software on the MySQL-client EC2 Instance

- Update package repository:

```
sudo apt update -y
```

- Install MySQL Client 

```
sudo apt install mysql-client -y
```

### Step 4 - Configure MySQL Server Security, Create Database and User.

- Connect to MySQL prompt:

```
sudo mysql
```

- Then run the following ALTER USER command to change the root userâ€™s authentication method to one that uses a password. The following example changes the authentication method to mysql_native_password:

```
ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY 'password';
```

- After making this change, exit the MySQL prompt:

```
exit
```

- log back into the mysql console using the root user, you will be prompted to input the password which is "password" in our case.

```
sudo mysql -u root -p
```

- Create a new database and user with privileges to access it. 

```
CREATE DATABASE test_db;

CREATE USER 'Revelation'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';

GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON test_db.* TO 'Revelation'@'%';

FLUSH PRIVILEGES;

exit
```

### Step 5 - Configure MySQL server for Remote Access

- Open the MySQL configuration file using a text editor:

```
sudo vi /etc/mysql/mysql.conf.d/mysqld.cnf
```

- Find the line that starts with bind-address and change its value to 0.0.0.0 to listen on all interfaces:

![bind-address](images/bind-address.png)

-  Restart the MySQL service for the changes to take effect:

```
sudo systemctl  restart mysql
```

### Step 6 - Connect to Mysql db server from the MySQL client

- Connect to the MySQL server from Mysql client and start querying the Mysql database from the client machine.

```
mysql -u username -h <MySQL-server-private-ip-address> -p
```

### Important Security Considerations:

- Strong Passwords: Always use complex passwords for root and user accounts.

- Minimize Remote Access: If possible, avoid enabling remote access to the MySQL server for enhanced security.

- Security Groups: Restrict access to the MySQL server using security groups, allowing connections only from authorized sources.

- Regular Updates: Keep your MySQL server and operating system software up-to-date with the latest security patches.

### Conclusion:

This guide has comprehensively explained how to build a client-server architecture using MySQL on AWS with Ubuntu Linux. We've learned about client-server principles, set up EC2 instances with security groups, installed and secured the MySQL server, and established a connection from the client to manage our database. Remember to prioritize security by implementing strong passwords, minimizing remote access, and keeping software updated.
